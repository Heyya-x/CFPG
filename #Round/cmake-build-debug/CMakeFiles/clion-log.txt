CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:2 (project):
  The CMAKE_C_COMPILER:

    /usr/local/Cellar/gcc/11.2.0/bin/gcc-11

  is not a full path to an existing compiler tool.

  Tell CMake where to find the compiler by setting either the environment
  variable "CC" or the CMake cache entry CMAKE_C_COMPILER to the full path to
  the compiler, or to the compiler name if it is in the PATH.
